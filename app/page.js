          <FAQs>
            <div>
              <h3>How long does it take to build a website?</h3>
              <p>
                The timeframe depends on the complexity of the project. On
                average, a custom website design project can take between 1 - 2
                weeks.
              </p>
              <h3>Will my website be mobile-friendly?</h3>
              <p>
                Absolutely! We design all our websites to be responsive, which
                means they will adapt to any screen size and provide an optimal
                user experience on all devices.
              </p>

              <h3>What about website security?</h3>
              <p>
                We implement various measures to secure your website, including
                SSL certificates, secure coding practices, and regular updates
                and backups.
              </p>

              <h3>Do you provide website hosting?</h3>
              <p>
                While we primarily focus on web design, we can certainly assist
                you in finding the right hosting solution for your website.
              </p>

              <h3>How much input can I have in the website design?</h3>
              <p>
                Your input is vital. We'll work closely with you throughout the
                design process to ensure the website aligns with your vision and
                meets your business needs.
              </p>
              <h3>Do I need local SEO?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, if your business operates in a specific geographical area,
                or if it has a physical location that customers can visit, then
                Local SEO is crucial. It can help your business stand out in
                local search results, drive more traffic from local customers,
                and ultimately increase sales.

                include services such as regular updates, backups, and
                performance optimizations.

              <h3>What is your payment structure for web design projects?</h3>
              <p>
                We typically require an initial deposit before we begin, with
                the balance payable upon completion of the project. We also
                offer payment plans for larger projects.
              </p>

              <h3>Do you provide content for the website?</h3>

                While we primarily focus on design, we can help guide you in
                producing high-quality content, or we can recommend professional
                copywriters if needed.
              </p>
